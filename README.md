## Requirements

- Windows XP [(2.6.1 and lower) .NET Framework 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/details.aspx?id=17718)    
- Windows7/8/10 [(2.6.2 and later) .NET Framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-CN/download/details.aspx?id=42642)

Note: Because of [Github upgrade SSL as Tls12](https://blog.github.com/2018-02-23-weak-cryptographic-standards-removed/)(happened at Feb. 2018),
.NET4.0/WindowsXP was not supported since version `2.6.2`(.NET4.0 dose not support `Tls12`, so I removed auto update from old version `2.6.1`)
